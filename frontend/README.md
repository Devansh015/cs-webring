# Frontend (Future Development)

This directory is reserved for a future React-based frontend application.

## Planned Features

- **Interactive Directory**: Browse and search member sites
- **Site Profiles**: Detailed pages for each member site
- **Admin Dashboard**: Manage submissions and moderate content
- **Statistics**: View webring traffic and engagement metrics
- **Member Portal**: Allow members to update their site info

## Tech Stack (Planned)

- React 18+
- TypeScript
- Vite or Next.js
- TailwindCSS or styled-components

## Getting Started (Future)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## Notes

- Keep the widget (`/widget/`) independent of this frontend
- The frontend should consume `/data/webring.json` as the source of truth
- Consider adding a simple CMS or headless backend later
